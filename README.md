# Contactless Water Sensors

This is a small arduino script to read (XKC-Y25-PNP) and drive 3 leds accordingly.
This has been built to deal with the need to know when the tank is full.
There is a mode variable that enable ethier led on by default (goes dark when water reach sensor) or led off by default (light up when water rise).
It should be easy to modify if you need to use it on tank empty scenearii.
Could use deepsleep to preserve power
